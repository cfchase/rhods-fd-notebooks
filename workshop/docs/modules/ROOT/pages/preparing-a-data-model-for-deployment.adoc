After you train a model, you can deploy it by using the {productname-short} model serving capabilities.

To prepare it for deployment, you must move the model from your workbench to your S3-compatible object storage. You use the data connection that you created in the xref:storing-data-with-data-connections.adoc[Storing data with data connections] section and upload the model from a notebook. You also convert the model to the portable ONNX format. ONNX allows you to transfer models between frameworks with minimal preparation and without the need for rewriting the models.

.Prerequisites

* You created the data connection `My Storage`.

* You added the `My Storage` data connection to your workbench.

.Procedure

. In your Jupyter environment, open the `2_save_model.ipynb` file.

. Follow the instructions in the notebook to make the data model accessible in storage and save it in the portable ONNX format.

.Verification

When you have completed the notebook isntructions, the `models/fraud/model.onnx` file is in your object storage and it is ready for your model server to use.
