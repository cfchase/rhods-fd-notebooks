Now that the data model is accessible in storage and saved in the portable ONNX format, you can use an {productname-short} model server to deploy it as an API.

{productname-short} multi-model servers can host several models at once. You create a new model server and deploy your model to it.

.Procedure

. In the {productname-short} dashboard, navigate to *Models and model servers*.
. Click *Add server*.
